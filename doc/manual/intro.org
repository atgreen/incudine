* Introduction
Incudine is useful to design software synthesizers or sound plugins
from scratch, exploiting the expressive power of Common Lisp, without
the constraint to use pre-built unit generators. It is also a
compositional tool that allows to produce high quality sounds
controllable at the sample level, defining and redefining the digital
signal processors and the musical structures on-the-fly.

Incudine introduces the Virtual UGen (VUG), a new mechanism for
defining primitive unit generators by writing concise and reusable
code. The definition of a VUG contains lisp code and/or other nested
VUGs (or "real" UGens), and it is re-arranged (i.e. after the inference
of init- and performance-time actions) and compiled efficiently during
the creation of a DSP.
