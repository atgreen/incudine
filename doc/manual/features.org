* Features
 - Realtime synthesis with sample-by-sample or block-by-block
   processing (without a realtime garbage collector but there
   are facilities for defining cons-free DSP).

 - Arbitrary precision. The sample type is double float but the
   unit generators and the DSP's don't require a particular type.
   In practice the init-time and performance-time functions of
   UGEN or DSP are arbitrary lisp functions regulated by the
   context (i.e. realtime audio).

 - Node tree for DSP instances and arbitrary actions.

 - Realtime sample accurate scheduling.

 - Optional recovery of audio cycles suspended during gc by processing
   the cached audio inputs and MIDI events. For example, it allows HD
   recording without losing audio inputs during gc if there aren't xruns.

 - Collection of useful re-definable virtual unit generators.

 - Collection of GEN routines to fill memory buffers.

 - Bounce to disk and bounce to memory buffer.

 - MIDI support via [[http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi][PortMidi]] and [[https://jackaudio.org][Jack MIDI]].

 - MIDI File I/O support.

 - Open Sound Control support.

 - Stream socket support.

 - Serial I/O support.

 - Tempo change with arbitrary curves.

 - Import/Export a musical scale from/to scale file format.

 - MIDI tuning by sending a bulk tuning dump message with arbitrary
   checksum function or 128 single note tuning change messages
   (Exclusive Real Time).

 - Frequencies of a TUNING structure changed with the data received
   from a MIDI bulk tuning dump message.

 - Flexible voicer for voice management.

 - Score file format (rego file) with time-tagged lisp functions,
   lisp statements, lisp tags and arbitrary score statements.

 - The score file format supports the [[https://orgmode.org][Org]] markup language.

 - Optional standalone executable.

 - Optional interface to interact with the sound editor [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/][Snd]].

 - Optional cudere-clm package, the sound synthesis package CLM (Common Lisp Music) implemented in Incudine.

 - Optional interface to define a VUG for a [[https://www.ladspa.org][LADSPA audio plugin]].

 - Optional interface to define a VUG for a [[https://lv2plug.in][LV2 audio plugin]].

 - Optional [[https://www.fluidsynth.org/][FluidSynth]] SoundFont synthesizer support.

 - Incudine is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) version 2 or later.
