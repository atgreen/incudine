* Features
 - Realtime synthesis with sample-by-sample or block-by-block
   processing (without a realtime garbage collector but it's simple
   to define cons-free DSP).

 - Optional recovery of audio cycles suspended during gc by processing
   the cached audio inputs and MIDI events. For example, it allows HD
   recording without losing audio inputs during gc if there aren't xruns.

 - Sample accurate callbacks.

 - Bounce to disk and bounce to memory buffer

 - Arbitrary precision. The sample type is double float but the
   unit generators and the DSP's don't require a particular type.
   In practice the init-time and performance-time functions of
   UGEN or DSP are arbitrary lisp functions regulated by the
   context (i.e. realtime audio).

 - Optional standalone executable.

 - Optional score (rego) files with time-tagged lisp functions,
   lisp statements, lisp tags and arbitrary score statements.

 - Graph of DSP's.

 - Collection of useful re-definable virtual unit generators.

 - Collection of GEN routines to fill memory buffers.

 - MIDI support via [[http://portmedia.sourceforge.net/portmidi][PortMidi]] and [[https://jackaudio.org][Jack MIDI]].

 - MIDI File I/O support.

 - Open Sound Control support.

 - Tempo change with arbitrary curves.

 - Import/Export a musical scale from/to scale file format.

 - MIDI tuning by sending a bulk tuning dump message with arbitrary
   checksum function or 28 single note tuning change messages
   (Exclusive Real Time).

 - Frequencies of a TUNING structure changed with the data received
   from a MIDI bulk tuning dump message.

 - Flexible voicer.

 - The score (rego) file format supports the [[https://orgmode.org][Org]]
   markup language. It is possible to edit and organize score files with
   spreedsheet-like capabilities, headlines, unordered lists, blocks,
   properties, hyperlinks, todo items, tags, deadlines, scheduling, etc.

 - It is possible to create and edit a rego file in SES (Simple Emacs
   Spreadsheet) mode.

 - Optional interface to interact with the sound editor [[https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/][Snd]].

 - Optional cudere-clm package, the Incudine version of CLM.

 - Optional interface to use a [[https://www.ladspa.org][LADSPA audio plugin]] in a Virtual UGen.

 - Optional interface to use a [[https://lv2plug.in][LV2 audio plugin]] in a Virtual UGen.

 - Optional [[https://www.fluidsynth.org/][FluidSynth]] SoundFont synthesizer support.

 - Incudine is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
   version 2 or later.
